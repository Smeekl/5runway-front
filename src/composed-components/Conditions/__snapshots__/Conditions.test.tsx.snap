        Generally, Terms & Conditions are not a legal requirement, though, in many instances its in your best interest to have one in place. This is because Terms & Conditions are necessary for governing the contractual relationship between you and your users. They are essential for protecting your content from a copyright perspective as well as protecting you from potential liabilities.

        Youll likely need a Terms & Conditions document if any of the following apply to you:

      <p
        class="condition__items"
      >
        1. You have different user levels (eg. registered vs non-registered);
      </p>
      <p
        class="condition__items"
      >
        2. You want to set the rules for user behavior (including comments) and state grounds for termination of accounts;
      </p>
      <p
        class="condition__items"
      >
        3. Your users are allowed to upload content;
      </p>
      <p
        class="condition__items"
      >
        4. You participate in some kind of commerce, including affiliate programs;
      </p>
      <p
        class="condition__items"
      >
        5. Youd like to protect your website/app and its content by stating how it can be used.

    <div
      class="condition__check"

      <label

        <input
